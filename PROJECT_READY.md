### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):
> "I developed MediCare HMS, a full-stack hospital management system using Spring MVC and Hibernate. It features role-based access control with three user modules - Administrator, Doctor, and Receptionist. The system handles patient registration, prescription generation, and OPD management. I implemented BCrypt password encryption for security and used MySQL with connection pooling for optimal performance. The project demonstrates my proficiency in enterprise Java development, database design, and full-stack web application development."

### Demo Flow:
1. Show login → Explain authentication
2. Admin module → Employee management
3. Doctor module → Prescription generation
4. Receptionist module → Patient registration
5. Database schema → Explain relationships
6. Code structure → Explain MVC pattern
